# Mathematica Advent of Code
# 2022

This repository stores my [Advent Of Code](http://adventofcode.com/2022/) solutions for 2022, written in Mathematica.  Some of these solutions are simple one-liners, and others are procedural and not fundamentally different from most other common programming languages, and so don't have any READMEs associated with them.  Some (marked in **bold**) are more involved and have (or need) explanations.  I'm using .wls instead of .m, and trying to make the code somewhat readable as plaintext, but casual Mathematica in general is notebook-heavy, and isn't great to view on GitHub.

There's also a utilities file, Ulitities.nb, with some functions that proved useful in previous years.  This is not a true utils file, in that it isn't a paclet and that I don't import the function definitions directly, but it's mostly there as boilerplate code I can copy in when need be.

### Day 1: Where's The Wild Things' Star?

We're now setting up camp  
In the dew and the damp,  
On the hunt for the star-spangled berry,  

And the jungle is thick,  
But we have every trick  
That will make the dark forest less scary,  

So we'll head to the grove  
With its heavenly trove  
(It's a Dijkstra-type maze, so be wary)  

Then the stars will appear,  
And when fifty are here,  
We will eat and we'll drink and be merry.
